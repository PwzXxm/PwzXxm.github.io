This is my first project using Perl. I feel it is tedious to type formatted definitions to Quizlet(A website which can make flashcards for you) and I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to open browser and online dictionary pages. Why not combining these two?
It uses following APIs:

It is usually used to represent graphs. It is very interesting that its Chinese name literally translated as &amp;ldquo;Linked Forward Star&amp;rdquo;. You have two choices of paths to understand this.
Start from Forward Star.
Start from Adjacency List.
However, I would recommend to explore both ideas to have a better understanding.</description></item><item><title>POJ 3279 Fliptile</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/poj-3279/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/poj-3279/</guid><description>There are \(M \times N\) \((1 \le M, N \le 15)\)square tiles. Each tile can be flipped and the color of tile can change between black(1) and white(0).
When you flip a tile, 4 adjacent tiles will also be flipped. Note that the four adjacent flipped tiles will NOT cause their adjacent tiles to flip.
Given a configuration, find the minimum number of flips so that all square tiles become white.</description></item><item><title>Build a Proxy Server to Access Chinese IP Including Netease Music</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/proxy-server-cn-netease-music/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:39:00 +1100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/proxy-server-cn-netease-music/</guid><description>Sometimes we need to access Chinese content, like Youku Video, Netease Music (Cloud Music) and QQ music. It is very annoying to get &amp;ldquo;Can Only Be Streamed in Mainland China&amp;rdquo; or similar messages. Being tired of that, fortunately I have got a VPS from Aliyun and I build a proxy server using Shadowsocks on it and everything works smoothly now.
VPS You need to have a VPS with Chinese IP address, there are tons of choices, like Aliyun(Alibaba Cloud) and Tencent Cloud etc.</description></item><item><title>USACO Party Lamps</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/usaco-lamps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/usaco-lamps/</guid><description>A set of \(N\) \((10 \le N \le 100)\) lamps, numbered from 1 to N.

One cow from each farm need to go to the party and go back. There are \(M\) (\(1 \le M \le 100,000\)) weighted (represents time) one-direction roads connects pairs of roads. Cows are smart though, they want to go via the shortest path. The question is, what is the longest time the cow will take.</description></item><item><title>UVa 108 Maximum Sum</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/uva-108/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/uva-108/</guid><description>Given an array with size \(N \times N (N \le 100)\), find the maximum value of its subarray.
Link: Problem on UVa
Solutions First thought is to brute force - find all possible subarrays then the time complexity will be \(O(N^6)\). TLE for sure.
Then comes up with an algorithm that takes \(O(N^4)\), which is enough to AC.
However, it can be \(O(N^3)\), see solution 2.
Solution 1 We build a sum array which is the sum of the numbers in rectangle area with the top-left of the array and bottom-right node \(i, j)\).</description></item></channel></rss>
