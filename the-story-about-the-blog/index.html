<h2>- blog</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.pwzxxm.com">PwzXxm</a> is my first blog and also my first website I have ever built. I knew only a little bit of HTML before I started this project. I learned CSS and JavaScript while I&#39;m building the site. I also read a lot of source code and blog posts about how other people build their own site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It took me seven days. Finally, on the 10th of December, 2015, the site went alive. </p>

<p>Details about building the site. (click me) (not yet, still editing)</p>

<p>I was learning algorithms, c++ and practice ACM-ICPC but I stuck at graph theory and I did not have any progress on one particular problem for like three or four days. I always want to build a website and start writing some stuff. So I put other things aside and started to build this blog, and my friends give a lot of suggestions on the design of the website. Thank you.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why I really want to start this blog. One is that blogging helps me clear my thoughts. For instance, if you can teach an algorithm to a man which is new to him and he can understand the algorithm very well as your explanation is clear, you should also already have a deep understanding on this algorithm. So another reason is that I&#39;m hoping someone can learn something from my blog. There a story: one day, I was trying to learn KMP (a string search algorithm), I barely understand it. I read a lot of posts from other people&#39;s blog, watched youtube videos and tried to do it on a paper. Suddenly, I knew the ideas behind it. Thanks for the guys sharing their ideas and thinkings. </p>

<p>If anyone find any mistake on my blog, please feel free to contact me or leave a comment below the post. Contact details are shown on the footer on every pages of the blog.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s learn together and sharing ideas!</p>
