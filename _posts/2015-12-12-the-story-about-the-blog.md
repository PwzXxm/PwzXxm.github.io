[PwzXxm](http://www.pwzxxm.com) is my first blog and also my first website I have ever built. I knew only a little bit of HTML before I started this project. I learned CSS and JavaScript while I'm building the site. I also read a lot of source code and blog posts about how other people build their own site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It took me seven days. Finally, on the 10th of December, 2015, the site went alive.

Details about building the site. (click me) (not yet, still editing)

I was learning algorithms, c++ and practice ACM-ICPC but I stuck at graph theory and I did not have any progress on one particular problem for like three or four days. I always want to build a website and start writing some stuff. So I put other things aside and started to build this blog, and my friends give a lot of suggestions on the design of the website. Thank you.

There are two reasons why I really want to start this blog. One is that **blogging helps me clear my thoughts.** For instance, if you can teach an algorithm to a man which is new to him and he can understand the algorithm very well as your explanation is clear, you should also already have a deep understanding on this algorithm. So another reason is that **I'm hoping someone can learn something from my blog.** There a story: one day, I was trying to learn KMP (a string search algorithm), I barely understand it. I read a lot of posts from other people's blog, watched youtube videos and tried to do it on a paper. Suddenly, I knew the concept behind it. Thanks for the guys sharing their ideas and thinkings.

If anyone find any mistake on my blog, please feel free to contact me or leave a comment below the post. Contact details are shown on the footer on every pages of the blog.

Let's learn together and sharing ideas!
