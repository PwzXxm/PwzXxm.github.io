<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jekyll</a> is an static site generator, it is simple to use with YAML front matter. It is quite convenient to blog with markdown and Jekyll supports it build-in. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Github Pages</a> provide the space to host the website for free. Both of them are well-documented, and works well with each other. One thing that makes they works well but not perfect is that although Github Pages can generate the website using Jekyll but as it generates in safe mode, it does not support Jekyll plugin. However, the good news is we can generate the site locally and then push it to Github. It sounds like not convenient but we can write a bash script to do so automatically in one step. We will talk about it later.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Story About the Blog</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/the-story-about-the-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>PwzXxm</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/the-story-about-the-blog/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.pwzxxm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PwzXxm</a> is my first blog and also my first website I have ever built. I knew only a little bit of HTML before I started this project. I learned CSS and JavaScript while I&rsquo;m building the site. I also read a lot of source code and blog posts about how other people build their own site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jekyll</a>. It took me seven days. Finally, on the 10th of December, 2015, the site went alive.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
