It is usually used to represent graphs. It is very interesting that its Chinese name literally translated as &ldquo;Linked Forward Star&rdquo;. You have two choices of paths to understand this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start from <a href="#forward-star" rel="">Forward Star</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start from <a href="#adjacency-list" rel="">Adjacency List</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I would recommend to explore both ideas to have a better understanding. If you know some of it or you just don&rsquo;t care, you can jump to <a href="#static-linked-list" rel="">here</a> straight away.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>POJ 3268 Silver Cow Party</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/poj-3268/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>PwzXxm</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/poj-3268/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are one cow from each \(N\) (\(1 \le N \le 1000\)) farms want to go to the number X farm to have a party, hurrah! One cow from each farm need to go to the party and go back. There are \(M\) (\(1 \le M \le 100,000\)) weighted (represents time) one-direction roads connects pairs of roads. Cows are smart though, they want to go via the shortest path. The question is, what is the longest time the cow will take.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
