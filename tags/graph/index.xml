It is usually used to represent graphs. It is very interesting that its Chinese name literally translated as &amp;ldquo;Linked Forward Star&amp;rdquo;. You have two choices of paths to understand this.
Start from Forward Star.
Start from Adjacency List.

One cow from each farm need to go to the party and go back. There are \(M\) (\(1 \le M \le 100,000\)) weighted (represents time) one-direction roads connects pairs of roads. Cows are smart though, they want to go via the shortest path. The question is, what is the longest time the cow will take.</description></item></channel></rss>
