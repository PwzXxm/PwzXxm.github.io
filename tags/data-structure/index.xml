It is usually used to represent graphs. It is very interesting that its Chinese name literally translated as &amp;ldquo;Linked Forward Star&amp;rdquo;. You have two choices of paths to understand this.
Start from Forward Star.
Start from Adjacency List.
However, I would recommend to explore both ideas to have a better understanding.</description></item><item><title>Binary Tree</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/binary-tree/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/binary-tree/</guid><description>Binary tree is called so because of its shape. It&amp;rsquo;s like a tree, it have leaves and a root. In computer science, the &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; is usually upside down, the root at the top and leaves grow below it. It is binary so it every node only can have 0, 1 or 2 leaves.
Terminologies Leaf Node The node do NOT have any child nodes.
Inner Node The Node between the leaf node and the root.</description></item><item><title>Stack, Queue and Linked Lists</title><link>https://pwzxxm.com/stack-queue-linked-list/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://pwzxxm.com/stack-queue-linked-list/</guid><description>Stack, queue and Linked lists are basic data structures. They appear in our daily life. For example, stacks of intermodal containers at the port, waiting in line(queue) to ride a roller coaster and the film The Human Centipedeï¼Œif you know it.
Stack Intro Stack is like a stack of intermodal containers, or a stack of book. Every time you want to put a new item, you put above the original stack, not between or below.</description></item></channel></rss>
